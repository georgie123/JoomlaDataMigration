<h1 align="center">Joomla Data Migration</h1>

This is a Python process to transfert Joomla core data from a website to another.

## Core Data
When I say <b><i>Joomla core data</i></b>, I mean the users (with their access rights, messages, privacy contents ...) and the articles (with their rights, categories, tags ...).
<br>Some other tables are related to this core data and will be managed during the migration.

## Why
From my experience, it is very usefull for try a new template, a new extension, prepare the new version of your Joomla website, configure some specific backups, clean up a website ...
<br>Once installed, the process is fast and simple, just one-click and you will be happy.

## How it works
Set up a small text file in your computer to store the access of your two Joomla databases.
<br>In my code, this file is named <b><i>gjcY8d4q6mvC2WXy.ztxt</i></b>, at the root of my PyCharm directory (but put it where you want).
<br>Into this file, set up the two database access, the tables prefix, but also the domains (without http/https, and even if it is <b><i>localhost</i></b>).

<pre>
>>> SOURCE My original Joomla website
host:xxxxxxxxxxxx
port:330X
DB user:xxxxxxxxxxxx
DB password:xxxxxxxxxxx
DB name:xxxxxxxxxxx
Tables prefix:xx_
Domain:mydomain.fr

>>> TARGET My brand new Joomla website
host:xxxxxxxxxxxx
port:330X
DB user:xxxxxxxxxxxx
DB password:xxxxxxxxxxxx
DB name:xxxxxxxxxxxx
Tables prefix:xx_
Domain:test.mydomain.fr
</pre>

<br>Then the code will search your two access from the first line describing an access.
<br>Call your access file from the script named <b><i>_params.py</i></b>, changing his path but also the two first lines describing the access.

<br>Take your time to set up the <b><i>_params.py</i></b>, because it manages the source and the target websites.
<br>The <b><i>source</i></b> is your original website, maybe in production üòØ
<br>The <b><i>target</i></b> website is your brandnew website, <b>consider it as a sandbox during the first migration</b> (then you can work on it, but please consider it as a sandbox for the first time you run the process).

<br>In my <b><i>_params.py</i></b> script, you will see specific blocks managing my PyCharm directories on my two computers üòÅ
<br>Of course, you can simplify this script to only find and read your access file, no more.

## Start
OK, then, just run the script named <b><i>start.py</i></b>!
<br>Each time this script is launched, the core data of the target website is deleted. So you can run <b><i>start.py</i></b> as many times as you want, to get the last updates from the source website.

<br>The source website is never updated during the process, so it is secure but be careful to well understand the script <b><i>_params.py</i></b> and the access file.

<br>This script will run all the scripts placed in the directory named <b><i>transferts</i></b>. So you can add your own scripts to manage other specific tables if needy.

## URLs
In <b><i>transferts/_2_contents.py</i></b>, I manage the links going to the website itself and the URL rewriting. Feel free to cancel this management if needy.

## Validated
<ul>
<li>OK from J3.9.23 to J5.0.2!</li>
<li>OK from J3.9.23 to a J5.1.1!</li>
</ul>

## What's next
I plan to add an automatic listing of the paths of all the images and files used in the articles.
<br>With a such list, we will be able to build some command lines to get/move them in another server.

<br>And sorry for my english ... I am french, lol.
